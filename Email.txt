Subject: Release Announcement: Helwan Linux Dev v3.1 – Major Update with Native Ecosystem

Dear DistroWatch Team,

We are excited to announce the official release of Helwan Linux Dev v3.1, 
a global distribution focused on performance, security, and ethical innovation.

Technical Highlights of v3.1:

Native Ecosystem: This release features significant updates to over 10 native tools, 
including the hpm package manager, Momo diagnostics, 
and Hel-Sync for mobile connectivity.

Enhanced Security: We have implemented critical security patches and addressed multiple 
		   vulnerabilities in core system packages.

Performance Boost: Significant optimizations have been made to ensure a faster, 
		   more stable desktop experience.

Project Philosophy:
	This release, launching on April 24th, carries a profound message. 
	It serves as a tribute to humanity, marking the Armenian Genocide Remembrance 
	Day and the World Day for Laboratory Animals. Guided by our principle, 
	"Study the greats, then you become greater," we believe that technical 
	innovation must always be aligned with ethical values and human rights.

We invite your community to explore a distribution that combines a unique native 
toolset with a strong moral identity.
